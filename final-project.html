While it’s hard to recall the details precisely at this point, I remember my friend recommending the app to me because it was, as they claimed, <strong>"a fun little game"</strong> we could play as we passed our days in our hometown for the summer. At the time, Tinder felt like a slightly refined Chat Roulette, and while I was a bit nervous it would invite in creeps, I thought the prospect of using it to have silly conversations with my friends sounded promising, and in truth, it was. My friend group and I passed the summer having delightful and atrocious conversations with any boy in a fifty-mile radius. We never went on a real date because that would be way too weird, but mindlessly scrolling and giggling amongst ourselves under the hot white sun was always a pleasant way to pass the time.</p><p>That Fall though, <strong>the game started to change</strong>. I had just transferred to UC Berkeley, a massive school of over 30,000 undergraduates, and while I thankfully had some friends there already, I also felt incredibly lonely in this brand new environemnt, and thus, I turned back to my favorite summer game, the one I had played endlessly over the past several months. This time, however, <strong>the game had elevated.</strong> I found myself on a brand new level, one I hadn't ever reached before. Here, in this new setting, the game escalated from simply being digital and instead became live-action. I could no longer hide behind a screen, or change my avatar through a few clicks. I had to act out the role I was portraying and so did the other players. These new levels were fun and interesting to me, and I found myself excelling beyond what I had previously thought possible. While I continued to enjoy the new levels I found myself in, the game was yet to become <em>real</em> to me. I was still in the simulacra, not the simulation. <strong>I always knew I was playing a game.</strong> </p><p>However, a year to the date that I initially unlocked these new levels, everything changed again when I returned to school in the Fall, and it happened so easily. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="729" height="328"></figure><p>I met Yoshi on September 22, 2018. He was designed perfectly, <strong>the exact love interest I would want from my live-action dating game</strong>. I felt as though the algorithm must have created him <em>for me</em>—pulled this new character out of all my interests and desires and into one essential persona. While I quickly discovered that the developers had pushed this version out with a few small bugs still intact, I was still so excited to be playing this new level that I believed it wasn't anything I couldn’t work through. I had been challenged before and still been successful, so while this one brought forward the need for new tactics I hadn’t previously considered, I was committed to solving its puzzles, and was, ultimately, determined that I would.</p><p>However, <strong>Yoshi was completey different obstacle than anything I had experienced before.</strong> At first,<span style="color: #000000;"> </span>I thought my goal was simple—go on several dates and explore this newfound universe, contemplate this characters lore and learn what you can, and push yourself past prior limitations. I could do that, I thought. Nothing seemed too out of the usual. But then, as the lore progressed, I found myself winding down paths I had never been on as the game grew trickier to navigate. <strong>Before the goals were relatively stagnant, but now I discovered they were evolving as I progressed.</strong> I was several months in when I began to imagine <em>how</em> things could change, something I hadn't previously done. Again though, I thought I had a grip on it. I was, as I would soon discover, mistaken. </p><p>Previously, I had believed my goals were to date and advance—a simple cycle. Then, I began to realize the game wanted me to date and advance with Yoshi <em>specifically</em>. Okay, I thought, I can do that. He was a great comrade on my journey, and I was happy to continue playing with him. I thought we needed to use the strengths of one another to get to the next level, a level I had long dreamt of reaching, the notorious,<strong> relationship level.</strong> I could see it before my eyes, I felt confident of what would come next. <strong>The app had long ago gamified dating,</strong> and I believed that I was happy to take part in this brave new world. It was a simulacra after all, right? I couldn't lose, or so I thought. </p><p>The truth was that the game was an evolving mechanism, with tasks changing while I was in them, and goalposts constantly being moved. I thought I was working toward reaching the <strong>relationship level</strong>, but to my surprise I was in fact much further from reaching that arena than I had previously accounted for. Instead, I spent months frivously playing, meeting new characters through Yoshi's lore and exploring new realms I wouldn't have discovered without his companionship. I soon graduated from college, no closer to the relationship level I had assumed would proeprly come to me. My graduation was a ceremony of defeat, and I said goodbye to my long-standing companion and went on to form a new path. I thought the game would offer me someone new. To my suprise,<strong> it gave me Yoshi again. </strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="740" height="258"></figure><p>The summer passed and I completed more quests with Yoshi, this time I assumed we were both leveling up. While I assumed at this point we weren't supposed to reach the relationship level, I started to get confused about where the game was taking me. <strong>Were we really supposed to be doing side quests with eachother forever?</strong> It was starting to feel like it, but then sometimes, we would end up on a path that looked to be paralell to the relationship path. The <strong>simulacra</strong> was begining to evolve, and I started to feel myself losing confidence in the game I had been in for so long. I couldn't see any way to win this level, and I couldn't seem to escape. I thought, <strong>I must have to do something differently, but what? </strong></p><p>I decided to ask Yoshi if we could change the game. <strong>I confided in him that I believed the game wasn't progressing any further because we needed to progress it ourselves.</strong> We were no longer at the mercy of the machine, instead it had given us free will to an extent. I believed we were suposed to play this game together as the clues seemed to instigate that. In spite of my better judgement though, I left that conversation and arrived in a brand new landscape—alone again, and where I couldn't see any roads to take. <strong>It was at this point that the simulacra had begun to fall into the simulation for me, and I felt my emotions, my real emotions, begin to take control.</strong> Logically, I knew the confines of game weren't real, but physically, after having been in the game for so long, my body could no longer tell the difference. I thought, maybe I'm simply supposed to find a new path. But, then I also thought, <strong>what if I have to try again?</strong> </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.11.03-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.11.03-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.11.03-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.11.03-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.11.03-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.11.03-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.11.03-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="754" height="258"></figure><p>It turns out the latter was the correct choice. I was merely being challenged in a way I hadn't been before. I thought I was starting the level over, but in actuality, I had been moved to a new level altogether—higher than before, and so had Yoshi. We spent months together as we had before. <strong>The crux of the game was that you didn't know if you were winning until after you had won.</strong> In the midst of everthing, I again found myself confused where this level was taking me. This time though, I approached my concerns differently. I told him, I think the game needs us to move to the next level together, and if he doesn't come, I would leave the game altogether, once and for all. To be honest, I was so entwined in the <strong>simulation </strong>that I didn't even know if this was possible to escape, but I thought I'd have to try. As it turns out, the prospect of losing me altogether would cause him to lose everything he had strived for as well, and so finally we found ourselves in the long-awaited <strong>relationship level</strong>, for me, nearly three years after I had first started the game.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="140" height="132"></figure><p>Somehow, I thought this level would be the same as before, relatively spekaing. I had learned how to communicate, and how to create long-standing partnerships, I had learned how to be charming with others, and how to be forgiving and open. I thought, what more could I learn? I soon realized though that there was a lot to learn. Suddenly, the game wasn't existing solely in a player mode anymore, of tasks being accomplished and new ventures. <strong>The game was rooted solely in your willingness to give in again and again.</strong> I fought against these new found constraints, as the freedom I previously had was lost in favor of long-term commitment. I couldn't understand how this leel upended my freedom, but I felt this everyday. In contrast, Yoshi did much better at this level than I did. He had been here before with other players and he knew how to excel. I hadn't though, and this naievete eventually started crashing down around me.</p><p><strong>I would self-sabotage and lose a level, again and again and again.</strong>  A pattern emerged, one where I would lose the game just for the thrill of being able to play again. I wasn't happy in the game anymore but that didn't even matter. I was in so deep that I couldn't even see that I was in a game anymore. <strong>I was no longer in the simulacra at all, but now, I was entirely in the simulation. </strong>I felt as though I was contantly glitching—like I couldn't get past anything at all. I both feared when I would eventually lose and was convinced I could never lose. <strong>But the simulation was endless, right? </strong></p><p>I chose to go upstairs one evening instead of hanging out with his friends, I lost that level. I played again. I got my feelings hurt because Yoshi couldn't hang out one weekend, I lost that level. I played again. I told him I sometimes thought about dating other players, I lost that level. I played again. I didn't eat dinner one evening because Yoshi had ordered the wrong meal, I lost that level. I played again. I got upset that Yoshi got breakfast with his brothers after we had already planned to get breakfast with eachother one morning, I lost that level. I played again. I asked him about an old fling too much, I lost that level. I played again. I drunkenly yelled at a guy who I thought was being mean to Yoshi one day, I lost that level. I played again. <strong>Over and over and over, again and again and again. </strong></p><p>One day, the endless repetition of this level came to a grinding hault. Yoshi broke-up with me, something I honestly didn't think was truly possible. <strong>Suddenly, the entire simulation came crashing down around me.</strong> I was thrilled, heartbroken, hilarious, insane. After all these years, the game seemed to have finally allowed me the privlege to lose. The feelings came in waves. I would sit in disbelief some days that the game was over—really over—and I would cry for hours, days, weeks, months over this loss. I didn't know anymore what was real and what was not, wandering between the simulacra and the simulation, confused what it all could mean. And then, just when I thought I had finally, really truly lost the game, <strong>there it was again. </strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.16.06-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.16.06-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.16.06-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.16.06-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.16.06-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.16.06-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-11.16.06-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="767" height="158"></figure><p class="align-left">I thought for a long time that I had simply lost the game, and that that was the end—<strong>game over</strong>.
