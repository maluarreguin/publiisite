While it’s hard to recall the details precisely at this point, I remember my friend recommending the app to me because it was, as they claimed, <strong>"a fun little game"</strong> we could play as we passed our days in our hometown for the summer. At the time, Tinder felt like a slightly refined Chat Roulette, and while I was a bit nervous it would invite in creeps, I thought the prospect of using it to have silly conversations with my friends sounded promising, and in truth, it was. My friend group and I passed the summer having delightful and atrocious conversations with any boy in a fifty-mile radius. We never went on a real date because that would be way too weird, but mindlessly scrolling and giggling amongst ourselves under the hot white sun was always a pleasant way to pass the time.</p><p>That Fall though, <strong>the game started to change</strong>. I had just transferred to UC Berkeley, a massive school of over 30,000 undergraduates, and while I thankfully had some friends there already, I also felt incredibly lonely in this brand new environemnt, and thus, I turned back to my favorite summer game, the one I had played endlessly over the past several months. This time, however, <strong>the game had elevated.</strong> I found myself on a brand new level, one I hadn't ever reached before. Here, in this new setting, the game escalated from simply being digital and instead became live-action. I could no longer hide behind a screen, or change my avatar through a few clicks. I had to act out the role I was portraying and so did the other players. These new levels were fun and interesting to me, and I found myself excelling beyond what I had previously thought possible. While I continued to enjoy the new levels I found myself in, the game was yet to become <em>real</em> to me. I was still in the simulacra, not the simulation. <strong>I always knew I was playing a game.</strong> </p><p>However, a year to the date that I initially unlocked these new levels, everything changed again when I returned to school in the Fall, and it happened so easily. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="729" height="328"></figure><p>I met Yoshi on September 22, 2018. He was designed perfectly, <strong>the exact love interest I would want from my live-action dating game</strong>. I felt as though the algorithm must have created him <em>for me</em>—pulled this new character out of all my interests and desires and into one essential persona. I was so excited to be playing this new level, and while there were a few small bugs in it at first, it wasn’t anything I believed I couldn’t work through. I had been challenged before and still been successful, so while this one brought forward the need for new tactics I hadn’t previously considered, I was committed to solving its puzzles, and was, ultimately, determined that I would.</p><p>However, as it turns out, Yoshi was completey different than anything I had experienced before. <span style="color: #e03e2d;">At first,</span> I thought my goal was simple, go on several dates and simply explore this newfound universe. Contemplate his lore, learn what you can, push yourself past prior limitations, don't give too much. I could do that. Then I was presented with the next set of challenges—the hometown holidays. Here, things got trickier. I was several months in at this point, and these new characters added a dimension I hadn't previously come across in this game. I stayed resilient though, and was still coming up on top, but at this point I started to imagine <em>how</em> things could change, something I hadn't previously done. Before the goals were relatively stagnant, now they were evolving as I progressed. Again though, I thought I had a grip on it. I was, as I would discover, mistaken. </p><p>After the holidays, Yoshi informed me that he could see himself being in a relatinhsip with me because I had done so well in the previous games. I thought, oh, I'm advancing, I'm get to reach a new level, the relationship level. I had never gotten this far before and the prospect of victory was thrilling to me. I could see it before my eyes, I knew what would come next. Until the game started to change. After that conversation I played the same way I always had, as that always brought me to victory. I thought, at the time, the same tactics would work again. This is where I realized I had made a horrible error. Seeing as this was a live action game, we were against players of all different levels than ourselves. While I had been paired with those of a higher point value than me, our score was left to ourseleves, so we didn't know exactly who we were ever up against. With the range of players I'd come across I had long ago believed that it didn't quite matter there score, as the objective of the game was staright forward. <strong>The app had long ago gamified dating,</strong> and I was happy to take part in this brave new world. </p><p>But the game was an evolving mechanism, so tasks would change while i was in them, the goalpost would be moved. A month into this new task, Yoshi told me that <em>his</em> agenda had changed. He no longer, needed me to be his girlfriend to win the level and this was staggering to me. I thought, <em>why would the game give me this new objective just to take it away?</em> I didn't understand, but I knew the game existed, at these in this fashion, on a purely proximity based level, so I thought maybe I can just do some sidequests here until I graduated in the coming months. While I was dissapointed that I wouldn't win this round the way I had previously believed I could, I thought that's fine, I was likely getting ahead of myself anyway, as this is a slow playing game I had learned at this point. </p><p>So I spent the next several months frivously playing, meeting new characters through Yoshi's lore and exploring new realms I wouldn't have discovered without his companionship. Then, I graduated. I said goodbye to my long-standing companion and went on to form a new path. I thought the game would offer me someone new. <strong>And then he texted me again. </strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.04.38-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="740" height="258"></figure><p>Okay, I thought, maybe I just need to proceed a little farther, that can happen. The summer passed and we I completed more quests with Yoshi, we were both, I thought, leveling up. While I knew we weren't supposed to reach the relationship level, I started to get confused about where the game was taking me. Were we really supposed to be doing side quests with eachother forever? It was starting to feel like it, but then sometimes, we would end up on a path that looked to me, paralell to the relationship path. The <strong>simulacra</strong> was begining to evolve for me, I couldn't confidently play out in the game I had been in for so long. I couldn't see any way to win this level, and I thought, I must have to do something differently, but what? </p><p>I decided to ask Yoshi, my companion and long time challenge, if we could change the game. I confided in him that I think, the game wasn't progressing any further because we needed to progress it ourselves. We were no longer at the mercy of the machine, the machine had instead give us free will, to an extent. I thought we were suposed to play this game together as the clues seemed to instigate that. Like the kind player he is, he diagreed with me, and said that he thought we were on different paths. I left that conversation and arrived in a brand landscape, one where I couldn't see any roads to take. As the simulacra had begun to fall into the simulation for me, I felt my emotions, my real emotions, begin to take control. Logically, I knew game wasn't real, but physically, having been in the game for so long, my body couldn't tell the difference. I thought, maybe I'm simplu supposed to find a new path. But, I also thought, <strong>what if I have to try again?</strong> </p><p>It turns out, that was the correct choice. I was merely being challenged in a way I hadn't been before. I was starting the level over, or so I thought. As I would soon discover, I wasn't starting the level over. Actually, I had been moved to a new level, higher than before, and so had Yoshi. We spent Valentines Day together, and then the end of the world hit, COVID-19, and I was starting to wonder what new level we found ourselves in. Was this the holiday level? The apocolype level? I had never heard of that before. <strong>The crux of the game was that you didn't know if you were winning until after you had won.</strong> Months into the apocolypse level, I again found myself confused where this level was taking me. This time though, instead of asking Yoshi as i had before if we should move to a new level, I told him, I think we need to move to a new level. I think the game won't escalate unless we do, I think we need to agree to go to the next level together. Yoshi is a much different player than I am, and his approach to this world is slow-moving and logical. He needed time to think he said, and I started to panic that I was about to lose my key to the next level, all over again. But I was wrong. He agreed t continue the game together, and we moved forward into the <strong>relationship level</strong>, finally, nearly three years after I had first started the game.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-27-at-1.49.27-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="140" height="132"></figure><p>Somehow, I thought this level would be the same as before, relatively spekaing. I had learned how to communicate, and how to create long-standing partnerships, I had learned how to be charming with others, and how to be forgiving and open. I thought, what more could I learn? I realized, soon, that there was a lot to learn. Suddenly, the game wasn't existing solely in a player mode anymore, of tasks being accomplished and new ventures. <strong>I was no longer in the simulacra at all, but now, I was entirely in the simulation.</strong> The game was rooted now in your ability to give things up and feelings, two areas I had not bee used to. Instead of thinking of your companion when you were working on something together, you needed to keep their livlihood at mind all the time. The game developers were getting creative too, as the relationship level for us entirely took place within the apocolyspe level as well. I fought against these new found constraints, as the freedom I previously had was lost in favor of commitment. I couldn't understand how commitment created a loss of freedom, but I felt this everyday. Yoshi did much better at this level than I did. He had been here before with other players, he knew how to excel. I didn't and this naievete eventually started crashing down around me. <strong>I would self-sabotage and lose a level, again and again and again.</strong> While I grew objectively better each time I loss and was given the oppurtunity to play again, I fell into my own patterns constantly. I fell for my own faults again and again and again. A pattern emerged, one where I would lose the game just for the thrill of being able to play again. I wasn't happy in the game anymore but that didn't even matter. I was so deep into it I couldn't even see that I was in a game anymore. Instead of rememebring to hold my contollers differently, press different buttons, move in a different way, I felt as though I was contantly glitching, like I couldn't get past anything at all. Everyday I both feared when I would eventually lose and was convinced I could never lose. The simulation was endless, right? </p><p>I chose to go upstairs one evening instead of hanging out with his friends, I lost that level. I played again. I got my feelings hurt because Yoshi couldn't hang out one weekend, I lost that level. I played again. I told him I sometimes thought about dating other players, I lost that level. I played again. I didn't eat dinner one evening because Yoshi had ordered the wrong meal, I lost that level. I played again. I got upset that Yoshi got breakfast with his brothers after we had already planned to get breakfast with eachother one morning, I lost that level. I played again. I asked him about an old fling too much, I lost that level. I played again. I drunkenly yelled at a guy who I thought was being mean to Yoshi one day, I lost that level. I played again. <strong>Over and over and over, again and again and again. </strong></p><p>One day, the relationship level we were on changed. We broke-up one day, I lost that level. I played again. I told him I loved him still after the break-up, I lost that level. I played again.</p><p>[Paragraphs about the realationship] [Challenges, interplay the title through these scenarios, etc] [Find myself falling into the simulation, no longer the simulacra] [losing, or feeling as though i lost] [gamification, degaification] [but, i didn't this is a game, i got distracted, because its a simulation, so i ask myself] [do you want to play again?] [I need to make Yoshi's character more lovable, more a person for others to understand how he could be loved] </p><p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">After the last conversation we had, I couldn't help but feel defeated. I had finally, completey merged with the simulation. The game wasn't just a game anymore, it was my real life, it seeped into the magnitude of my mind, and I was lost within it.</span> I thought for a long time that I had simply lost the game, and that that was the end—<strong>game over</strong>. But in time, I remembered what was <em>really</em> going on. A game isn't over just because you lost. You can always play a game again and again and again. The point isn't to sit in defeat, or to reimagine where you went wrong. No. </p><p>The point is to ask yourself, <em>do you want to play again? </em></p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="906" height="544"></figure><figcaption>Over and over and over—again and again and again. </figcaption></figure></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Malu Arreguin | UCLA | maluarreguin@g.ucla.edu</p><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
