While it’s hard to recall the details precisely at this point, I remember my friend recommending the app to me because it was, as they claimed, <strong>"a fun little game"</strong> we could play as we passed our days in our hometown for the summer. At the time, Tinder felt like a slightly refined Chat Roulette, and while I was a bit nervous it would invite in creeps, I thought the prospect of using it to have silly conversations with my friends sounded promising, and in truth, it was. My friend group and I passed the summer having delightful and atrocious conversations with any boy in a fifty-mile radius. We never went on a real date because that would be way too weird, but mindlessly scrolling and giggling amongst ourselves under the hot white sun was always a pleasant way to pass the time.</p><p>That Fall though, <strong>the game started to change</strong>. I had just transferred to UC Berkeley, a massive school of over 30,000 undergraduates, and while I thankfully had some friends there already, I also felt incredibly lonely in this brand new environemnt, and thus, I turned back to my favorite summer game, the one I had played endlessly over the past several months. This time, however, <strong>the game had elevated.</strong> I found myself on a brand new level, one I hadn't ever reached before. Here, in this new setting, the game escalated from simply being digital and instead became live-action. I could no longer hide behind a screen, or change my avatar through a few clicks. I had to act out the role I was portraying and so did the other players. These new levels were fun and interesting to me, and I found myself excelling beyond what I had previously thought possible. While I continued to enjoy the new levels I found myself in, the game was yet to become <em>real</em> to me. I was still in the simulacra, not the simulation. <strong>I always knew I was playing a game.</strong> </p><p>However, a year to the date that I initially unlocked these new levels, everything changed again when I returned to school in the Fall, and it happened so easily. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-12.18.37-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="729" height="328"></figure><p>I met Yoshi on September 22, 2018. He was designed perfectly, <strong>the exact love interest I would want from my live-action dating game</strong>. I felt as though the algorithm must have created him <em>for me</em>—pulled this new character out of all my interests and desires and into one essential persona. I was so excited to be playing this new level, and while there were a few small bugs in it at first, it wasn’t anything I believed I couldn’t work through. I had been challenged before and still been successful, so while this one brought forward the need for new tactics I hadn’t previously considered, I was committed to solving its puzzles, and was, ultimately, determined that I would.</p><p>However, as it turns out, Yoshi was completey different than anything I had experienced before. </p><p>[Paragraphs about the realationship] [Challenges, interplay the title through these scenarios, etc] [Find myself falling into the simulation, no longer the simulacra] [losing, or feeling as though i lost] [but, i didn't this is a game, i got distracted, because its a simulation, so i ask myself] [do you want to play again?] </p><p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">After the last conversation we had, I couldn't help but feel defeated. I had finally, completey merged with the simulation. The game wasn't just a game anymore, it was my real life, it seeped into the magnitude of my mind, and I was lost within it.</span> I thought for a long time that I had simply lost the game, and that that was the end—<strong>game over</strong>. But in time, I remembered what was <em>really</em> going on. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">But now, I understand it differently.</span> A game isn't over just because you lost. You can always play a game again and again and again. The point isn't to sit in defeat, or to reimagine where you went wrong. No. </p><p>The question is to ask yourself, now, <em>do you want to play again? </em></p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-xs.png 300w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-sm.png 480w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-md.png 768w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/media/posts/3/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-11-26-at-4.36.08-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="906" height="544"></figure><figcaption>Over and over and over—again and again and again. </figcaption></figure></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Malu Arreguin | UCLA | maluarreguin@g.ucla.edu</p><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/publiisite/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
